## Types of Tests

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End to end tests

## [Jest](https://jestjs.io)

Jest is a testing framework built on top of Jasmine, and it is used for unit and integration testing

### Unit Tests

Tests an individual function or component (in other words, a single _unit_); all functions or components needed to run the test are _mocked_.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work well together, such as components and services.

### Running unit and integration tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Jest.

## [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io)

Cypress is an end to end testing framework

### End to End Tests

End to end tests replicate user behavior throughout the entire application from end to end, verifying that a user flow works as expected.

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress.
